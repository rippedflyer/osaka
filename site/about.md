{{site.title}} is an online calendar for punk events in Osaka and Kansai. It's hosted as a static website so it's free. I never pay for SHIT if I don't have to.

Events are mined automatically from Instagram. If you notice any wrong information, submit a pull request on <a href="{{site.footer_links[1].user_url}}">{{site.footer_links[1].user_title}}</a>. Meta killed its Instagram API so we're using a third-party API for this that gets blocked etc, so it might die at some point. I run it about once a week.

Code is open source at [vriibot/insta-calendar](https://github.com/vriibot/insta-calendar).
